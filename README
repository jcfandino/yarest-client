yarest-client is yet another REST Client that implements the JAX-RS standard.
Most JAX-RS frameworks (like CXF, RESTEasy, Jersey or Crest) provide libraries that create dynamic proxies from a service endpoint interface (SEI). The problem with these libraries is that is hard to make them running in an Android environment.
The objective of this project is to make a similar library that works on Android or a standard java vm out of the box.

At the moment it provides JSON messaging using the Gson library.
The whole jsr-311 spec is not implemented yet, but it's usable for the most cases.

This project is built using maven.
